1. Use 2013 closing stock data and tweets for training purposes
2. Use 2014 closing stock data and tweets for testing purposes

3. Probabilities of fluctuations on day-to-day basis for stock price 
4. Probabilities of fluctuations on day-to-day basis for tweet sentiment

Prior probabilities can be adjusted based on new data:
For instance, if for every 10-day set of stock prices, there is consistently observed a day where the price sharply increases or decreases, this can be said to be a pattern. This training data is then used to create a Prior probability for this event. In this case, the Prior is 1/10. Therefore, we assign a 10% chance of seeing a sharp increase or decrease in the value of the stock every 10 days.

n = 10
P(+|n) = .10
P(~+|n) = .90

Bayesian Algorithm: 
P(+|n) = P(n|+)P(+) / P(n)
